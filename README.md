1. Call the financial data interface of listed companies provided by tushare pro, import and analyze such stock market data indicators as TS stock code, trading date, total market value, price to sales ratio (ps), price to earnings ratio (pe) and price to book ratio (pb). Based on the DataFrame data structure of Pandas, sort and filter all stocks according to different attributes, and use regular expressions to implement fuzzy queries for specific stocks, which is convenient for users to search efficiently.

Based on the Fama-French three-factor model, select a time point to screen the top 10 potential stocks in the stock pool according to the conditions that pe is less than 10, pb is less than 5, and the total market value is less than 500000. Based on the market value weighted method, use numpy mathematical function library, such as linalg.lstsq function to perform multiple linear regression calculation on each stock, and to give a list of stocks recommended to buy or sell according to alpha intercept.
3. Use matplotlib, graph, cycler and other modules to draw and compare the bar charts and line charts of stock capital flow, and import mplfinance library to draw daily candlestick chart and moving average, so as to achieve visual analysis of financial data.
